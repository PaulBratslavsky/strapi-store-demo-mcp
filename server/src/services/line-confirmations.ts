 * - `failed`: LINE refused it or couldn't be reached, and a `failed` notification says why.
 * - `already_sent`: a `sent` notification already exists, so nothing was sent.
 * - `not_confirmed`: the visit has no published version, so nothing was sent.
 * - `past`: the visit is over, so nothing was sent, as pending_confirmations lists none.
 * - `not_found`: no appointment has this reference.
 * - `not_configured`: there's no channel access token, or no liffUrl for the message's link. Nothing was sent or recorded.
