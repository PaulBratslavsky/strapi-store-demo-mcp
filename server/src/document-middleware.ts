/**
 * Same rules for the admin and the tools: every create/update goes through the Document Service.
 *
 * And the same confirmation: publishing an appointment confirms the visit, whichever way it happens. That's the board's
 * Confirm, the admin chat and MCP clients (all through appointments.confirm), and Publish in the Content Manager.
 * - A publish of its own, as appointments.confirm makes it, has committed by the time `next()` resolves. Strapi then
 *   sends the customer the LINE confirmation and waits for it, so the answer and the board's next refresh show how it
 *   went. The push's 8-second timeout bounds that wait.
 * - A publish inside someone else's transaction, as the Content Manager's Publish and bulk Publish make it, sends once
 *   that transaction commits, without making it wait. A push can't be rolled back, so a rolled-back publish sends
 *   nothing, and LINE's answer never holds the database (SQLite has one connection). The board shows the outcome on
 *   its next refresh.
 * Sending never fails the publish.
