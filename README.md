# Maison: a luxury house's catalog over Strapi MCP

A Strapi 5 plugin that shows one content model serving people and AI agents. It adds a fictional luxury house, "Maison": collections, products, boutiques and stock. Signed-in customers can request boutique visits, and staff review and confirm them.

- **Ten MCP tools and one MCP prompt** on Strapi's `/mcp`, each gated by a permission you grant per token
- **The same tools in the admin's AI chat**, through [strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai](https://github.com/PaulBratslavsky/strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai) 1.6
- **A human gate:** agents can request appointments, but only staff confirm them
- **Customer identity comes from sign-in, never from the model**, through [strapi-oauth-mcp-manager](https://github.com/PaulBratslavsky/strapi-oauth-mcp-manager) 1.1 and LINE
- **A live requests board and demo data** in the admin panel, with content in Japanese and English

Maison is fictional. The plugin uses no real brand's names, products or images.

## Four surfaces, one set of services

| Surface | Who uses it | What decides access |
|---|---|---|
| MCP tools on `/mcp` | The customer app, its AI concierge, an ops agent in Claude Desktop | The admin token's Maison permissions |
| The admin's AI chat | Staff, through strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai | The admin's role, tool by tool |
| The Maison admin page | Staff | The admin's role |
| The Content Manager | Staff | Content Manager permissions |

Every surface calls the same services, so it gets the same answers. Confirming a request is one act wherever it happens: the `confirm_appointment` tool, the board's **Confirm** button and **Publish** in the Content Manager all publish the appointment. None of them messages the customer. An ops agent sends the LINE confirmation afterwards.

## Requirements

- Strapi `^5.55.1`, with the MCP server enabled: `mcp: { enabled: true }` in `config/server.ts`
- The i18n plugin, which is on by default
- For the customer tools, strapi-oauth-mcp-manager 1.1 with LINE sign-in configured. Without it, those tools answer `not_signed_in`.
- For the admin chat, strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai 1.6 with its chat configured. Maison needs no setup for it: the chat finds Maison's tools by itself.

## Install for local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaulBratslavsky/strapi-store-demo-mcp.git
cd strapi-store-demo-mcp
npm install
npm run link          # builds, then publishes to a local yalc store
```

In your Strapi app:

```bash
npx yalc@1.0.0-pre.53 add --link strapi-store-demo-mcp
yarn install          # or npm install
```

```ts
// config/plugins.ts
export default ({ env }) => ({
  maison: {
    enabled: true,
    config: {
      liffUrl: env('MAISON_LIFF_URL', null),
    },
  },
});
```

Restart Strapi. Open **Maison** in the admin menu and choose **Load demo catalog** under **Demo data**.

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `liffUrl` | `null` | Base of the links in LINE confirmations, e.g. `https://liff.line.me/<LIFF ID>`. Use `http://localhost:<port>` for local development. Until it's set, `pending_confirmations` answers `not_configured`. |
| `timezone` | `Asia/Tokyo` | Opening-hours checks, the times in messages, and the day of the `date` filter |
| `defaultLocale` | `ja` | Content language when a tool call doesn't pass `locale` (`ja` or `en`) |
| `maxOpenRequestsPerCustomer` | `3` | Unconfirmed future requests a customer may have |
| `houseName` | `{ ja: 'メゾン', en: 'Maison' }` | Header of the LINE confirmation |
| `disabledTools` | `[]` | Tool names to leave out of MCP and the admin chat |

## Tools

| Tool | Permission | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `browse_collections` | MCP: browse the catalog | Published collections, with a teaser and product count |
| `search_products` | MCP: browse the catalog | Products by collection, category, gift occasion, price, personalization and boutique stock |
| `view_product` | MCP: browse the catalog | One product: story, dimensions, personalization, stock per boutique |
| `find_boutiques` | MCP: browse the catalog | Boutiques, opening hours, open on a date, stock for chosen products |
| `request_appointment` | MCP: request and view own appointments | Creates a **draft** visit request for the signed-in customer |
| `my_appointments` | MCP: request and view own appointments | The signed-in customer's own requests and confirmations |
| `appointment_requests` | MCP: review appointment requests | Requests for staff, by default the ones still waiting. Customers are masked. |
| `confirm_appointment` | MCP: confirm appointment requests | Confirms a request by publishing it. It sends nothing. |
| `pending_confirmations` | MCP: send appointment confirmations | Confirmed visits not yet sent, each with a ready LINE flex message |
| `record_confirmation` | MCP: send appointment confirmations | Records whether a LINE confirmation was delivered |

The **`send_pending_confirmations` prompt** tells an ops agent how to deliver confirmations with [LINE Bot MCP](https://github.com/line/line-bot-mcp-server). It checks that each customer is reachable (`get_profile`) before pushing, because LINE's push API answers 200 even when it can't deliver. The prompt drives both `pending_confirmations` and `record_confirmation`, so disabling either one in `disabledTools` also drops the prompt.

**Errors don't throw.** They come back as `isError` results whose text is `{"error":{"code","message","hint"}}`. The codes are `not_signed_in`, `not_found`, `invalid_input`, `boutique_closed`, `in_the_past`, `too_many_open_requests`, `not_published` and `not_configured`. The hint says what to do next.

## The admin chat

strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai 1.6 finds Maison's `ai-tools` service and offers six of its tools as `maison__<name>`:
- the four catalog tools
- `appointment_requests` and `confirm_appointment`

Each tool is offered only to admins whose role holds its permission. The customer tools are left out, because a chat has an admin rather than a LINE customer. `record_confirmation` is left out because it only follows a LINE push, and `pending_confirmations` because its result carries customers' full LINE user ids.

## The admin page

**Maison** in the admin menu is shown to admins with "MCP: review appointment requests" or "Load and reset demo data":
- **Appointment requests:** a board that refreshes every 5 seconds. You can filter it to requests waiting for staff, confirmed ones, or all. Admins with "MCP: confirm appointment requests" get a **Confirm** button on requests whose visit is still ahead.
- **Demo data:** **Load demo catalog** and **Reset demo appointments**.

## Tokens

Strapi's `/mcp` only accepts **admin** API tokens. Create them under **Settings → Administration Panel → Admin Tokens** and grant only the Maison permissions a caller needs:
- **Customer token:** "MCP: browse the catalog" and "MCP: request and view own appointments". Map it to the LINE client in oauth-mcp-manager. Every customer session runs with this token's permissions, so keep it narrow.
- **Staff token:** "MCP: browse the catalog", "MCP: review appointment requests" and "MCP: confirm appointment requests", for an agent that works for staff.
- **Ops token:** only "MCP: send appointment confirmations".

The same permissions on an **admin role** decide what staff see in the chat and on the Maison page. "Load and reset demo data" is an ordinary admin role permission.

## Customer identity

A tool never takes the customer as an argument. Customer tools pass the caller's own `Authorization` header to oauth-mcp-manager:

```ts
strapi.plugin('strapi-oauth-mcp-manager').service('oauth').resolveSubject(authorization); // 'line:U…' or null
```

Anything but `line:U` followed by 32 lowercase hex characters counts as not signed in. That includes plain admin tokens, staff sessions, and a missing oauth-mcp-manager. Staff tools and the board show customers masked, as in `line:U4af…88`, and never the full LINE user ID.

## Run the ops agent

Point Claude Desktop at Strapi with the ops token and at LINE Bot MCP with a Messaging API channel access token. Then run the `send_pending_confirmations` prompt. The URL below is LaunchPad's dev server; Strapi's default port is 1337.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maison": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:1338/mcp", "--header", "Authorization: Bearer ${MAISON_OPS_TOKEN}"],
      "env": { "MAISON_OPS_TOKEN": "<ops token>" }
    },
    "line-bot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@line/line-bot-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<channel access token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Extend it

- **Fields:** extend any Maison content type from your app with `src/extensions/maison/strapi-server.ts`.
- **Your own tools:** register them in your app's `register()`, reusing the plugin's services:
  - `strapi.plugin('maison').service('identity').getCustomerSubject(extra)` for the signed-in customer
  - `service('errors').toolError(code, message, hint)` for errors in the same shape
  - `service('catalog')` and `service('appointments')` for the same logic the tools use, including `listRequests` and `confirm`
- **Fewer tools:** list them in `disabledTools`.

## Development

```bash
npm test                    # unit tests (vitest)
npm run test:ts:back        # type-check the server
npm run test:ts:front       # type-check the admin
STRAPI_APP_DIR=/path/to/strapi-app npm run test:integration   # boots that app against throwaway SQLite files
node --env-file=/path/to/strapi-app/.env scripts/mcp-dev-tokens.mjs && npm run test:mcp   # against a running app
```

The plugin runs from `dist/`, so rebuild (`npm run link`) and restart Strapi after changing it.
