# Maison: a luxury house's catalog over Strapi MCP

A Strapi 5 plugin that shows one content model serving people and AI agents. It adds a fictional luxury house, "Maison": collections, products, boutiques and stock. Signed-in customers can request boutique visits, and staff review and confirm them.

- **Ten MCP tools and one MCP prompt** on Strapi's `/mcp`, each gated by a permission you grant per token
- **REST routes at `/api/maison`** for websites: the catalog under Strapi's role permissions, and bookings for the signed-in LINE customer, on the same services, input checks and sign-in as the tools
- **Six of the tools in the admin's AI chat**, through [strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai](https://github.com/PaulBratslavsky/strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai) 1.6
- **A human gate:** agents can request appointments, but only staff confirm them
- **Customer identity comes from sign-in, never from the model**, through [strapi-oauth-mcp-manager](https://github.com/PaulBratslavsky/strapi-oauth-mcp-manager) 1.1 and LINE
- **A live requests board and demo data** in the admin panel, with content in Japanese and English

Maison is fictional. The plugin uses no real brand's names, products or images.

## Five surfaces, one set of services

| Surface | Who uses it | What decides access |
|---|---|---|
| MCP tools on `/mcp` | The customer app, its AI concierge, an ops agent in Claude Desktop | The admin token's Maison permissions |
| REST routes at `/api/maison` | Websites and other apps | The catalog: a role or API token holding its action. Bookings: a LINE customer session |
| The admin's AI chat | Staff, through strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai | The admin's role, tool by tool |
| The Maison admin page and Homepage widget | Staff | The admin's role |
| The Content Manager | Staff | Content Manager permissions |

The tools, the REST routes, the chat, the board and the Homepage widget call the same services, so they give the same answers. The Content Manager goes through the Document Service instead, with the same validation on create and update.

Confirming a request is one act wherever it happens: the `confirm_appointment` tool, the board's **Confirm** button and **Publish** in the Content Manager all publish the appointment. None of them messages the customer. An ops agent sends the LINE confirmation afterwards. One difference: **Publish** in the Content Manager doesn't check the visit time, so it can confirm a visit that has already passed.

## Requirements

- Strapi `^5.55.1`, with the MCP server enabled: `mcp: { enabled: true }` in `config/server.ts`
- The i18n plugin, which is on by default
- For the customer tools and the customer routes, strapi-oauth-mcp-manager 1.1 with LINE sign-in configured. Without it, those tools answer `not_signed_in` and those routes answer 503.
- For the admin chat, strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai 1.6 with its chat configured. Maison needs no setup for it: the chat finds Maison's tools by itself.

## Install for local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaulBratslavsky/strapi-store-demo-mcp.git
cd strapi-store-demo-mcp
npm install
npm run link          # builds, then publishes to a local yalc store
```

In your Strapi app:

```bash
npx yalc@1.0.0-pre.53 add --link strapi-store-demo-mcp
yarn install          # or npm install
```

```ts
// config/plugins.ts
export default ({ env }) => ({
  maison: {
    enabled: true,
    config: {
      liffUrl: env('MAISON_LIFF_URL', null),
    },
  },
});
```

Restart Strapi. Open **Maison** in the admin menu and choose **Load demo catalog** under **Demo data**.

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `liffUrl` | `null` | Base of the links in LINE confirmations, e.g. `https://liff.line.me/<LIFF ID>`. Use `http://localhost:<port>` for local development. Until it's set, `pending_confirmations` answers `not_configured`. An empty value counts as not set. |
| `timezone` | `Asia/Tokyo` | Opening-hours checks, the times in messages, and the day of the `date` filter |
| `defaultLocale` | `ja` | Content language when a tool call doesn't pass `locale` (`ja` or `en`) |
| `maxOpenRequestsPerCustomer` | `3` | Unconfirmed future requests a customer may have |
| `houseName` | `{ ja: 'メゾン', en: 'Maison' }` | Header of the LINE confirmation |
| `disabledTools` | `[]` | Tool names to leave out of MCP and the admin chat |

## Tools

| Tool | Permission | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `browse_collections` | MCP: browse the catalog | Published collections, with a teaser and product count |
| `search_products` | MCP: browse the catalog | Products by collection, category, gift occasion, price, personalization and boutique stock |
| `view_product` | MCP: browse the catalog | One product: story, dimensions, personalization, stock per boutique |
| `find_boutiques` | MCP: browse the catalog | Boutiques, opening hours, open on a date, stock for chosen products |
| `request_appointment` | MCP: request and view own appointments | Creates a **draft** visit request for the signed-in customer, and names the boutique and products in the customer's `locale` |
| `my_appointments` | MCP: request and view own appointments | The signed-in customer's own requests and confirmations |
| `appointment_requests` | MCP: review appointment requests | Requests for staff, by default the ones still waiting. Customers are masked. |
| `confirm_appointment` | MCP: confirm appointment requests | Confirms a request by publishing it. It sends nothing. |
| `pending_confirmations` | MCP: send appointment confirmations | Confirmed upcoming visits not yet sent, each with a ready LINE flex message |
| `record_confirmation` | MCP: send appointment confirmations | Records whether a LINE confirmation was delivered |

The **`send_pending_confirmations` prompt** tells an ops agent how to deliver confirmations with [LINE Bot MCP](https://github.com/line/line-bot-mcp-server). It checks that each customer is reachable (`get_profile`) before pushing, because LINE's push API answers 200 even when it can't deliver. The prompt drives both `pending_confirmations` and `record_confirmation`, so disabling either one in `disabledTools` also drops the prompt.

**Errors don't throw.** They come back as `isError` results whose text is `{"error":{"code","message","hint"}}`. The codes are `not_signed_in`, `not_found`, `invalid_input`, `boutique_closed`, `in_the_past`, `too_many_open_requests`, `not_published` and `not_configured`. The hint says what to do next.

One exception on MCP: arguments that fail the MCP SDK's schema check, such as a date that isn't on the calendar, come back as plain text (`Input validation error: …`), not in the JSON error shape. Errors from the tools themselves are always JSON.

## Three doors, one service layer

Maison's services sit behind three HTTP doors. Each door checks who is calling in its own way, then calls the same services with the same input checks.

| Door | Path | For | Who may call |
|---|---|---|---|
| REST routes | `/api/maison/…` | Websites and other apps | The catalog: a role or API token. Bookings: a LINE customer session |
| Admin routes | `/maison/…` | The requests board and the Homepage widget | Admins whose role holds the action |
| MCP tools | `/mcp` | Agents | Admin tokens with Maison permissions |

### The REST routes

| Route | Mirrors | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/maison/collections` | `browse_collections` | `plugin::maison.collections.find` |
| `GET /api/maison/products` | `search_products` | `plugin::maison.products.find` |
| `GET /api/maison/products/:slug` | `view_product` | `plugin::maison.products.findOne` |
| `GET /api/maison/boutiques` | `find_boutiques` | `plugin::maison.boutiques.find` |
| `POST /api/maison/appointments` | `request_appointment` | A LINE customer session |
| `GET /api/maison/my-appointments` | `my_appointments` | A LINE customer session |

Each route takes its tool's input, checks it with the same schema (`server/src/mcp/schemas.ts`), and answers with the tool's structured content:
- **Query parameters** have the tool's argument names, limits and checks: `?occasion=travel&maxPriceJpy=400000&locale=en`.
- **A list repeats its parameter:** `?productSlugs=weekender-50&productSlugs=passport-cover`. One is a list of one. A comma-separated list isn't split, so it fails the slug check.
- **`locale`** is `ja` or `en`, and defaults to `defaultLocale`, as on the tools. A booking takes it in the body.
- **The booking body** is `request_appointment`'s input, as JSON: `boutique`, `productSlugs`, `requestedFor`, and an optional `note` and `locale`. The `locale` picks the language of the boutique and product names in the answer. Any other field is ignored, a customer included.
- **A booking** answers 201 with `{ "appointment": … }`. The requests board shows it as made via `web`.

```bash
STRAPI=http://localhost:1338   # the demo's Strapi; a stock Strapi listens on 1337

# The catalog, once a role holds its actions (below)
curl "$STRAPI/api/maison/collections?locale=en"
curl "$STRAPI/api/maison/products?occasion=travel&maxPriceJpy=400000&inStockAt=ginza&locale=en"
curl "$STRAPI/api/maison/products/weekender-50?locale=en"
curl "$STRAPI/api/maison/boutiques?productSlugs=weekender-50&productSlugs=passport-cover&date=2026-10-10"

# Bookings, with a customer's LINE session
curl -X POST "$STRAPI/api/maison/appointments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SESSION" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"boutique":"ginza","productSlugs":["weekender-50"],"requestedFor":"2026-10-10T14:00:00+09:00","note":"A gift","locale":"en"}'
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SESSION" "$STRAPI/api/maison/my-appointments?locale=en"
```

**Errors** are `{ "error": { "code", "message", "hint" } }`, with the code, message and hint the tool would return. The hints are the tools' own words, so a tool they name stands for its route: `search_products` is `GET /products`.

| Status | Code | When |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_input` | The shared schema rejects a value (no hint; MCP answers these as `Input validation error: …`), or a minimum price is above the maximum |
| 401 | `not_signed_in` | A customer route has no LINE customer session. Sent with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` |
| 404 | `not_found` | An unknown product, collection or boutique |
| 409 | `boutique_closed`, `too_many_open_requests` | The same request can succeed once something changes: the boutique's hours, or one of the customer's open requests |
| 422 | `in_the_past` | The visit starts less than 30 minutes from now |
| 503 | `not_configured` | Customer sign-in isn't configured: oauth-mcp-manager 1.1 isn't installed |
| 503 | `temporarily_unavailable` | Checking a customer's session failed on the server, such as a database error. It isn't a sign-out: try again. Only the REST door has this code |

Strapi answers some requests itself, in its own error body: a 403 when no role or token holds a catalog action, and a 401 for a bearer token it doesn't recognize on a catalog route.

### Grant the catalog

The catalog routes use Strapi's content-API permissions, so a request needs one of these:
- **A role holding their actions,** under **Settings → Users & Permissions plugin → Roles**: **Public** for a public website.
- **A read-only, full-access or custom API token,** under **Settings → API Tokens**. A custom token needs the actions. A read-only token can call them because they're named `find` and `findOne`, the only actions Strapi lets a read-only token call.

The four actions:
- `plugin::maison.collections.find`, for `GET /collections`
- `plugin::maison.products.find`, for `GET /products`
- `plugin::maison.products.findOne`, for `GET /products/:slug`
- `plugin::maison.boutiques.find`, for `GET /boutiques`

The list there also shows the two customer actions, `plugin::maison.customer.requestAppointment` and `plugin::maison.customer.myAppointments`. Roles don't apply to them, so granting them opens nothing.

These actions aren't the admin token permissions under Tokens. "MCP: browse the catalog" (`plugin::maison.catalog.read`) gates the tools only.

### The customer session

The customer routes take the same session as the MCP tools: the access token oauth-mcp-manager issues for a customer's LINE sign-in. The routes set `auth: false`, so users-permissions doesn't refuse that token, and Maison's `customer-session` policy checks it instead:
- It passes the `Authorization` header to `identity.customerSession`, the function behind the tools' `getCustomerSubject`.
- That first runs `/mcp`'s session check, oauth-mcp-manager's `resolveAccessToken`, and only then asks `resolveSubject` whose session it is. The tools skip the first step, because `/mcp` has already run it on their request.
- A LINE customer gets through, as `ctx.state.maisonCustomer`. The routes book and list for that customer only.
- Anything else is a 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`: no header or a malformed one, an unknown, expired, revoked or rotated session, a user who is no longer active, a staff session, an admin or API token, or a users-permissions JWT.
- Without oauth-mcp-manager 1.1, it's a 503 `not_configured`, which says customer sign-in isn't configured.
- If checking the session fails on the server, such as a database error, it's a 503 `temporarily_unavailable`, not a 401: the session may still be good.
- It never logs a token, the admin key behind a session, or a full LINE user ID.

`/mcp` goes further than that check in two ways:
- **An expired admin token.** Strapi core also refuses a session whose admin token has expired (`checkExpiry`). The REST door accepts that session until the session itself expires: at most the session TTL, 1 hour, because oauth-mcp-manager issues no new session for an expired admin token. Closing this gap belongs in oauth-mcp-manager, with `resolveAccessToken` refusing an expired admin token, in a later release.
- **The tool's permission.** Each tool also needs its own permission on that admin token, such as "MCP: request and view own appointments" for `request_appointment`. The REST door doesn't check it: the customer's session is enough.

Send the session to the customer routes only. The catalog routes check tokens with Strapi's own content-API auth, which doesn't know LINE sessions and answers 401. A website on another origin also needs its origin in `strapi::cors`.

### Why the tools aren't REST wrappers

The two doors share what's underneath, not each other. A route doesn't call a tool, and a tool doesn't call a route: both call the services, with the same schemas and the same customer check. They're shaped for different callers:
- **An agent works through a task.** Each tool is one step of it. Its description tells the model when to use it and what it won't do, and its errors name the next tool to call, such as "Call find_boutiques to find valid boutique slugs."
- **A website works with resources.** It wants paths it can link to and cache, status codes, query strings, and Strapi's role permissions.
- **Some tools have no route, on purpose.** The staff tools sit behind the admin routes, for the board. `pending_confirmations` returns customers' full LINE user IDs, so it stays with the ops agent.

## The admin chat

strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai 1.6 finds Maison's `ai-tools` service and offers six of its tools as `maison__<name>`:
- the four catalog tools
- `appointment_requests` and `confirm_appointment`

Each tool is offered only to admins whose role holds its permission. The customer tools are left out, because a chat has an admin rather than a LINE customer. `record_confirmation` is left out because it only follows a LINE push, and `pending_confirmations` because its result carries customers' full LINE user ids.

## The admin page

**Maison** in the admin menu is shown to admins with "MCP: review appointment requests" or "Load and reset demo data":
- **Appointment requests:** a board that refreshes every 5 seconds. You can filter it to requests waiting for staff, confirmed ones, or all. Admins with "MCP: confirm appointment requests" get a **Confirm** button on requests whose visit is still ahead.
- **Demo data:** **Load demo catalog** and **Reset demo appointments**.

## The Homepage widget

**Maison requests** on the admin's Homepage is shown to admins with "MCP: review appointment requests":
- Three cards count one pipeline of visits still ahead: **Waiting for staff**, **Confirmed, upcoming**, and **LINE sent**, the confirmed visits whose LINE confirmation has been sent. They wrap when the widget is narrow.
- Below them, a table lists the five newest requests, newest first. A narrow widget scrolls it sideways. Its columns are:
  - **Requested:** how long ago the request came in, like "12 min ago", and from a day on its date, like "Oct 1". Hover for the full date and time.
  - **Reference**, **Customer** (masked, like `line:U4af…88`) and **Boutique**.
  - **Visit:** the visit time in Tokyo.
  - **Note:** what the customer wrote, cut to one line. Hover for all of it. A dash when there is none.
  - **Status** and **LINE** ("LINE sent" or "not sent"), in the words and colours of the board.
- It refreshes every 5 seconds. If a refresh fails, it keeps the last result on screen with a note.
- **Open the board** goes to the Maison page. It shows the same three cards above the board, and the board has a **Note** column too, where the whole note wraps instead of being cut.

Its numbers and rows come from `GET /maison/appointments/summary`, which calls `appointments.summarizeRequests()` and follows the board's own definitions. Each row is a row of the board's "All requests" view, without the products and `createdVia`: its `createdAt` is when the request came in, and its `note` is what the customer wrote. Strapi keeps each admin's Homepage layout once they've changed it, so an admin who has moved or removed widgets adds this one with **Add Widget**.

## Tokens

Strapi's `/mcp` only accepts **admin** API tokens. Create them under **Settings → Administration Panel → Admin Tokens** and grant only the Maison permissions a caller needs:
- **Customer token:** "MCP: browse the catalog" and "MCP: request and view own appointments". Map it to the LINE client in oauth-mcp-manager. Every customer session runs with this token's permissions, so keep it narrow.
- **Staff token:** "MCP: browse the catalog", "MCP: review appointment requests" and "MCP: confirm appointment requests", for an agent that works for staff.
- **Ops token:** only "MCP: send appointment confirmations".

The same permissions on an **admin role** decide what staff see in the chat and on the Maison page. "Load and reset demo data" is an ordinary admin role permission.

## Customer identity

A tool never takes the customer as an argument. Customer tools pass the caller's own `Authorization` header to oauth-mcp-manager:

```ts
strapi.plugin('strapi-oauth-mcp-manager').service('oauth').resolveSubject(authorization); // 'line:U…' or null
```

Anything but `line:U` followed by 32 lowercase hex characters counts as not signed in. That includes plain admin tokens, staff sessions, and a missing oauth-mcp-manager. Staff tools and the board show customers masked, as in `line:U4af…88`, and never the full LINE user ID.

The REST customer routes run the same lookup through the `customer-session` policy, after running `/mcp`'s session check (see [The customer session](#the-customer-session)).

The Content Manager doesn't show an appointment's `customer` field at all, in the list or the edit view. The Document Service still reads and writes it, and saving or publishing an appointment in the Content Manager leaves it as it was.

## Run the ops agent

Point Claude Desktop at Strapi with the ops token and at LINE Bot MCP with a Messaging API channel access token. Then run the `send_pending_confirmations` prompt. The URL below is LaunchPad's dev server; Strapi's default port is 1337.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maison": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:1338/mcp", "--header", "Authorization: Bearer ${MAISON_OPS_TOKEN}"],
      "env": { "MAISON_OPS_TOKEN": "<ops token>" }
    },
    "line-bot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@line/line-bot-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<channel access token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Extend it

- **Fields:** extend any Maison content type from your app with `src/extensions/maison/strapi-server.ts`.
- **Your own tools:** register them in your app's `register()`, reusing the plugin's services:
  - `strapi.plugin('maison').service('identity').getCustomerSubject(extra)` for the signed-in customer
  - `service('errors').toolError(code, message, hint)` for errors in the same shape
  - `service('catalog')` and `service('appointments')` for the same logic the tools use, including `listRequests` and `confirm`
- **Your own routes:** guard a customer route with `config: { auth: false, policies: ['plugin::maison.customer-session'] }`, and read the customer from `ctx.state.maisonCustomer`. For an `Authorization` header anywhere else, `service('identity').customerSession(authorization)` always runs `/mcp`'s session check first. It answers `{ status: 'signed_in', subject }`, `{ status: 'signed_out' }`, `{ status: 'unavailable' }` when customer sign-in isn't installed, or `{ status: 'error' }` when checking failed on the server: answer that with a 503, not a 401.
- **Fewer tools:** list them in `disabledTools`.

## Development

```bash
npm test                    # unit tests (vitest)
npm run test:ts:back        # type-check the server
npm run test:ts:front       # type-check the admin
STRAPI_APP_DIR=/path/to/strapi-app npm run test:integration   # boots that app against throwaway SQLite files
node --env-file=/path/to/strapi-app/.env scripts/mcp-dev-tokens.mjs && npm run test:mcp   # against a running app
```

The MCP smoke tests (the last line) need:
- the Strapi app running at `STRAPI_URL` (default `http://localhost:1338`)
- an admin's credentials in the environment: `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, or `LOCAL_TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `LOCAL_TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `liffUrl` set in the app, or `pending_confirmations` answers `not_configured`

The token script also loads the demo catalog, then saves a customer, a staff and an ops token to `test/mcp/.tokens.json`, readable by you only.

The plugin runs from `dist/`, so rebuild (`npm run link`) and restart Strapi after changing it.
